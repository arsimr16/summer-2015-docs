# Creating Editions of the Main Text #

## Paper Editing ##

1. Your first step will be to edit a hard copy of the text. You will be given a print out of the Iliadic text that corresponds to what is on your folio.
2. With the folio up on at least one screen, working in groups of two or more, read through the text, marking any and all differences between your hard copy and what is on the screen.
3. You can ignore critical signs and speech markers.
4. You should mark the following:
  - differences in accents and breathing
  - differences in spelling
  - abbreviations
  - corrections and erasures
