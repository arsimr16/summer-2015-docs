# Installing Git #

Git is the version control software of choice for the HMT. You can install it by going to the following [link](https://git-scm.com/). 

If you have a Mac machine, the bash shell comes pre-installed on your machine. If you are running a Windows machine, see the relevant documentation for installing a git bash shell.
