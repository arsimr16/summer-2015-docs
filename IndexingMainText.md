# Indexing the Main Text #

1. In your github repository, go to the 'indices' folder and open the '...textToImage-Iliad.csv' file.
2. This file has two columns, one for Text URNs and one for Image URNs.
3. Select the edit button (top right corner, looks like a pencil).
4. Your text URNs should correspond to the Iliadic line you are indexing. Remember that this is a version specific urn, so there should be some reference for the manuscript you are working in.

e.g. urn:cts:greekLit.tlg0012.tlg001.msA:18.1 (refers to Iliad 18.1 in the Venetus A)
